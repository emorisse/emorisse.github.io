When someone we love passes unexpectedly, there’s a hole left in the world. It is dark and sharp and shaped exactly like them. Over time, the edges of the hole become ragged as the world starts to knit itself back together. There’s a shadow where that repair is, where the world isn’t the same again. A watermark left behind, to remind us of those we love.
