<p>Here are some simple steps you can take to start easy, and create a habit of expanding the value of your network by bridging gaps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make a list of everyone you have exchanged email with in the past month [<a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?hl=en&amp;source=navclient#search/after%3A2009%2F01%2F7+to%3Ame">gmail search</a>]</li>
<li>Add to your list some personal notes: what they do for a living, their likes, hobbies, etc.</li>
<li>Re-read through your list so it is fresh in your mind</li>
<li>Start at the top of your list, and think of one other person that person could benefit from knowing</li>
<li>If there is no immediate need for the two to know each other, find some bit of information particular to the two of them based on their job, interests, hobbies etc.</li>
<li>Send the info to both of them at the same time, and ask a question you want to know the answer to.  Don't forget to tell them why you're asking both of them. <em>Dear Scuba experts, my brother-in-law is looking for a new XYZ, what is your experience with this model... </em>If you can't think of a question you genuinely want to know, just send the info and the reason why you think they'd both find it useful.</li>
<li>Under each person in your notes, record you have connected the two of them, when it was, and what the topic was.</li>
<li>Done with your list?  Great!  Add another month's email to your list, and repeat.</li>
</ol>
<p><!--more-->A few of tips to consider as you go through this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Schedule time for this every week (or month, or day...)</li>
<li>Start slowly. You want this to be a habit, not an explosion</li>
<li>Only start as many conversations as you can carry</li>
<li>Introductions can be passive (as in the scuba example). They don't have to be Alice meet Bob, Bob meet Alice.</li>
<li>Each time you meet someone, try and introduce them to someone else</li>
<li>Spend at least as much time networking down, as you do up</li>
</ul>
<p>The more you contribute to your network (not just the individuals), the more opportunities, ideas, and information will come to you. I work hard at this, and there are still many many gaps to be closed. Just look at all those people who don't know each other!</p>
<p>I hesitated in putting this post up, as I doubt the web needs yet another <em>X Steps to....</em> post, but these have really helped me.  I hope they can help you too.</p>
<p>What are your personal networking tips?		</p>
