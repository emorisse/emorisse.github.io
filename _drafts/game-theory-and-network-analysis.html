<p>Some time back, I put together an essay showing an <a title="application of network analysis to a game theory problem" href="http://www.howweknowus.com/game-theory-network-analysis-an-example/">application of network analysis to a game theory problem</a> in predicting negotiation outcomes in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Because of a rising level of interest in the topic in general, and for Afghanistan in particular, I wanted to put out a couple of thoughts in problemset framing.</p>
<p>Game theory is a toolset for predicting outcomes.  It is increasingly difficult to model without simulation, as the number of players increases.  Further, small changes to the payoffs can have dramatic effects on the predicted outcomes.</p>
<p>Network analysis is a toolset for predicting potential. Many models, including the Burt* model I showed, both scales well and provides robust answers under conditions of poor data.  What it lacks,		</p>
