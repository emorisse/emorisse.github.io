				Sinan Aral, of NYU and one of the organizers of their excellent <a href="http://www.winworkshop.net/">WINS workshop</a>, has a great article over at <a href="http://poptech.org/e1_sinan_aral">PopTech</a> on homophily in networks: we seek out and communicate with people similar to ourselves.</p>
<blockquote><p>[F]riends tend to adopt the same behaviors or purchase the same products at approximately the same time. But is this because one friend influenced another to adopt the behavior or are friends simply more likely to like the same things and behave in similar ways?</p></blockquote>
<p>I'd like to volunteer a marketing hypothesis: it's doesn't matter.  You still have to</p>
