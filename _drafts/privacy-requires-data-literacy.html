<h2>Data literacy</h2>
<p>is both critical and exceptionally difficult. Focus on what can be done with data, not how. Expand understanding of common assumptions and model flaws.</p>
<h2>enterprise</h2>
<p>Many common overlaps with enterprise data, except we call it security</p>
<ul>
<li>who are the stewards for data?</li>
<li>which data?</li>
<li>what data is owned by employers v employees</li>
<li>Co-ownership?</li>
</ul>
<h2>life of data &gt; memories (and searchable )</h2>
<p>Everyone has been a moron. <strong>Everyone</strong> Should we be judged on the moronic things we did as a twelve year old? A twenty year old? How should hiring managers react to stupid crap employees and potential employees (students, customers, etc) posted online today? A year ago? 10 years ago?</p>

<li>aa: example of credit card use + facial recognition for highly targeted ads at the gas pump</li>
<li>jb: users need control over data, including "do not track"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>data use
<ul>
<li>db: ways to back into protected classes without using durectly</li>
<li>db: example : interview process; race is observable during face to face, but not actionable.</li>
<li>ee: bad business to release any customer info and facebook has contractual agreements with advertising partners that they <strong>may not</strong> use any of their targeting info to recreate or otherwise model the customer who clicked on a targeted ad.</li>
</ul>
