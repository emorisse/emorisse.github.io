				Dear CFO:</p>
<p>I know we usually don't talk unless I'm asking you for money, but this hybrid cloud thing seems like a great way to provide another tool in managing our business.  I know we talk about cloud and efficiency and the amazing things you can do with pay-by-the-hour, but let's be honest: we really haven't given you a reason to care.  So, here are three reasons: cash flow, inventory, and operating expenses.</p>
<p><strong><em>Lease vs Buy - Cash Flow &amp; the Pay-by-the-Hour Argument</em><br />
</strong><br />
You make decisions every day about what is more effective to purchase or lease.  Cloud, should you implement public-private, adds a tunable knob in your cash flow.  It is the ability to time the creation of your next (or first) data center. With the incredible cost involved in building a data center, the business benefit has to outweigh it, and needing just a few (or hundred) more servers to expand business likely ain't gonna cut it.  Consider cloud as a flexible lease on a partial data center: use it until it makes bottom line sense to bring it in-house.</p>
<p><em><strong>Inventory Ain't Inventory<br />
</strong></em><br />
Probably half or more of your server capacity is not doing anything, and I know that makes you crazy, but it's by design. Servers are plant, tools, and not consumable stock.  That unused capacity is available throughput in our business processes, and throughput ain't constant.  All that work it is to close your books at the end of the year, when your entire department don't see their families for a month? Same thing here, our servers seen an uneven demand over the course of each day.</p>
<p>You're right though, there are more efficient ways to provide capacity.  You probably hire temps at the end of the quarter and year to help with the last minute scramble to close your books, pay expenses, ensure revenue is calculated correctly, appease the auditors, etc. Same with cloud.  Using a public-private cloud helps us ensure we have the capacity we regularly need in-house, and bring in "temps" to help for the highest peak of work.</p>
<p><em><strong>Self-Service: Operating Expense Creating Tools, Not Stock<br />
</strong></em><br />
The near-zero cost of bit replication throws off our ability to talk about VMs and applications as the raw materials and finished product elements of inventory, but works in progress (WIP) still makes a lot of sense to track. Every time a customer requests a new server, there is a lot of operating expense (OE) in creating the server VM, installing applications, and configuring the OS and apps.  Between the initial request and hand-off to production, these are WIP.  When you use improving inventory turns as a benchmark on managing the company, we can do the same with self-service in the cloud.</p>
<p>To get to self-service, you change the investment of OE from creating WIP to creating tools.  These tools include the reusable elements (operating system, enterprise tools, common applications, tuning configurations) as well as automating how they work together. Once these are created and offered up through a self-service portal, we virtually eliminate all OE tied up in our WIP.</p>

<div><em><strong>IT as a Business Tool</strong></em></div>
<div><strong><br />
</strong></div>
<div>IT has come a long way in the past decade, and we've had to.  We're learning more about how to scale, how to absorb new technologies, and how to automate, but we're there's still a pretty big gulf between your language and ours.  With Cloud as one of the first large shifts in how we operate in a while, we're going to need your help in ensuring this is the right thing for the company.  But, with greater control over cash flow and inventory, and taking out huge swaths of operating income, it's worth the conversation.</div>
