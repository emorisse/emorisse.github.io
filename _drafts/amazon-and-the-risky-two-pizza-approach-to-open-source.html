<p>The whole fiasco can be summarized as "tragedy of the commons," but that does disservice to understanding the potential impact on consumers. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Amazon has been getting a lot of crap lately, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/09/aws-gives-open-source-the-middle-finger/">for creating services around open source software without giving back to the communities in due kind</a>. The concern is this practice undermines the commercial efforts of the developers, thereby throttling future work by limiting the resources which can be placed into the software. If you can't eat, you can't code.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It's not an idle concern: we've seen the beginnings of open source software providers taking action to defend their businesses against this concern. <a href="https://redislabs.com/community/commons-clause/">Redis</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/16/mongodb-switches-up-its-open-source-license/">MongoDB</a> are two recent examples.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>One way to look at the problems this creates for consumers is the division of risk and potential between consumers and open source software communities. In stock investing (stay with me here), one method of looking for a valuable stock is understand the difference between the potential for a company and the potential for the market a company is in, which is also shared across competitors. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Amazon really likes <a href="http://blog.idonethis.com/two-pizza-team/">two-pizza teams</a>, so let's walk through risk through the view of two pizza companies, and then step back to Open Source. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Domino's Pizza and Papa John's are both pizza delivery companies. The value of the companies are partially impacted by some of the same things including: price of ingredients, wages, gasoline as a cost of delivery, etc. This type of common impact required for participation in a market is called "beta."  As you have probably already guessed, there's also "alpha."</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Alpha is the risk and potential of the company itself, separate from the risk and potential of the market. Alpha includes execution risk.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Let's look at the difference between the two in <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/DPZ#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">a stock chart</a>. <font color="blue">Domino's Pizza (DPZ) in blue</font>, <font color="red">Papa John's (PZZA) in red</font>.</p>

<p>From 2004 through 2017, the value of the stocks of both companies are very similar. There are peaks and troughs as one does better than the other, but they're pretty similar. Papa John's attributes the fall starting in 2018 <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/story/14011259/1/papa-john-s-gets-thrashed-because-people-didn-t-eat-enough-of-its-pizzas.html">to falling NFL viewership</a>, which they invest in heavily as a marketing channel. I don't know whether that's true, but if it is, it looks like an overinvestment in that channel. An execution error.</p>

<p>And now, back to Open Source.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>One of the values in the use and participation in open source software is leveraging the expertise of other users and participants -- driving software quality together. There's a similar notion with functionality.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When you write code to support your business processes, the risk and reward are yours alone (alpha). When you gain agreement to push functionality into a healthy open source community, the risk and reward are shared across participants (beta).</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Now the idea of keeping the reward to yourself is tempting at first, but you need to think about the dirty little secret of software development: <strong>most of the code in a system provides you zero differentiation</strong>. Most of the code is necessary to get the system usable, but doesn't provide the differentiation. Is managing logins and users on your system a unique differentiator allowing you sell more pizza? Does automatic component failover uniquely help you sell more insurance? Not a chance. These are common requirements across company, industries, and geographies.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>By writing these yourself, you are carrying this risk without the potential for the corresponding reward. These type of non-differentiating functionalities are required across industries - you can consume these differentiating functionalities through open source and eliminate some unnecessary alpha risk.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ok, what does this have to do with Amazon?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Amazon's replication and repackaging of open source software, forking the code, shrinks the beta risk, and shifts more risk to its consumers (alpha).  Risk that would otherwise be supported by the community. </p>
