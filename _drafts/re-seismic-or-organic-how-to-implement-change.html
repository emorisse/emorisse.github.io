				Knowing when to throw your organization is into a seismic change is a hard question, and one with trade-offs.  Michael Pollock over at <a href="http://pollockspark.blogspot.com/2008/10/seismic-or-organic-how-to-implement.html">PollockSpark</a> has some practical advice, and I began considering this question from what seismic changes do to relationship networks.</p>
<p>Delaying a seismic change has some clear benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li>You will learn more about about what isn't working today.</li>
<li>You will lower the cost of the change itself, if you can take what you learn and be able to implement the change quicker.</li>
<li>You have time to build a clear communications strategy.</li>
</ol>
<p>You also have some messy drawbacks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Morale: large change is hard, but anticipation of large change is worse</li>
<li>Increase in office politics: inevitable in any time of uncertainty</li>
<li>Time to Market opportunity costs.  You're contemplating a seismic change because one of your fundamental assumptions has changed.  The sooner you can rebase to that new assumption, the sooner your organization can began working within it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your communication plan is important for any organization, but critical in any with a large number of knowledge workers.		</p>
