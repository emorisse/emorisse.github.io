<p>When I was in high school, everyone talked about Mike Tyson. I didn't know anything about boxing. No I knew, knew much about boxing. We all knew about Mike Tyson. He had such power, that his style was described as <a href="https://www.thrillist.com/culture/how-hard-could-mike-tyson-punch-measuring-punching-force-and-equivalents#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">"getting hit in the head by good sized anvil dropped from 5 feet."</a></p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>From the time he turned professional, Tyson dominated the heavyweight class. He became the youngest heavyweight world champion ever. And he defended it mercilessly.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Even if you ignore the power he had, his accuracy set him apart from all of the competition.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>36% MORE PUNCHES LANDED PER PUNCH THROWN</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>His energy cost to hit an opponent was significantly lower than his opponents' cost to hit him. Some of that energy he was able to use to hit hard over the duration of a fight.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>12 TITLE FIGHTS. 1,368 DAYS AS CHAMPION</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But, there's lots and lots of competition. Everyone wants the championship belt.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>One day, (Feb 11, 1990 in Tokyo), Tyson fought Buster Douglas. It was supposed to be a blowout. All but one Las Vegas casino refused to even take bets. It was going to be another short fight, a contest to see how quickly Tyson could win.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>And Tyson went for a knock-out, and stuck to this tactic consistently, even though Buster Douglas had the reach to stay out of his way. In a surprise upset, Douglas wore down, and eventually knocked out Mike Tyson for the win in the 9th round.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The fight is widely considered one of the biggest upsets in boxing, if not, sports history.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But, there was still lots and lots of competition. What works against one opponent doesn’t necessarily work against another. Douglas lost his very next fight, and would never regain the belt.</p>

<p><strong>COUNTER EXAMPLE</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>See all of the championship belts this guy, Floyd Mayweather, won?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Pu4kCN6vRunbOna2lRmQ5Xr2nlw8A-uf6Y0e3MJ8x5m3pkk7-bVvVEcWodNSOtrMprggF5BcbXV-l66mUIIJnsUAXAtMLNtIHdXivO-1mzI6HX7C3R7dOv54gVeuOU2KgWtyk753SjE" alt="" /></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Mayweather has had such an enduring career as champion (and no small notoriety as a braggart who backs up what he spouts), that he’s sometime used as examples in wildly non-boxing contexts as a winner.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/3B3GuDnT20QdpAnHEJ7Qe3QR_ZDLMbb-AtXN7Xi-HVBe4FacsbNfBlUxWmcrrs7xKhrBc2hY5-2-JbcSyJYeof0okTJtcCeDUGe4xQaJKBu4j5_V7OqDqgk0wl2TKgcg4PcYKJPgP00" alt="" /></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Mayweather's punching accuracy, is very similar to Mike Tyson's.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>35% MORE PUNCHES LANDED PER PUNCH THROWN</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>What he did, in addition to matching Tyson's accuracy, is not get hit. 84% of punches thrown at Mayweather missed. This is the lowest on record.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>LOWER COST PER PUNCH / HIGHLY EFFICIENT EXECUTION</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>HIGHER COST PER HIT / EXPENSIVE TO HIT</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So, not only did Mayweather optimize what he did. He also changed the game for his opponents. He punched efficiently, saving energy, and increased the cost of each punch that hit him. He changed his actions, and he changed the actions of others.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>CHANGED "MARKETS" OVER TIME</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Mayweather also evolved his "market" over time. This required a lot of him, but also brought his unique combination of ability to markets which had experienced it before.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Across all of these "markets," some of which he fought in simultaneously, <strong>he was never defeated.</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Tyson's record is outstanding. <em>Mayweather's is unbelievable</em>.</p>

<p><strong>SO, WHAT DOES STRATEGY DO?</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The importance of execution ranges from important to life-critical, depending on the growth of the market, which market, etc. Organizations, and individuals, who fail to tie execution and strategy won't succeed for for very long. But, how much, and how it’s done, is generally not part of strategy.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If we’re selling to beach goers, the market on the left is great. If we’re selling access to the beach, the one of the right is much better.</p>

<figcaption>Eat Adjacent Markets</figcaption>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>An important part of market selection is, if you're successful, the ability to grow into additional markets. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<figcaption>Control How Others Enter Your Markets</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This is one of the most important elements of strategy. Make it less expensive to hold your ground, so you can expend your energy on pursuing organizational objectives. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Tyson was efficient. His 36% higher accuracy meant he had more energy to expend on each punch. That's more energy for pursuing his objective (knocking the other guy to the ground).</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Mayweather also had more energy to pursue his objectives, as he had a similarly high accuracy rate. He also made it very hard for others to hit him. This increased the cost of his opponents to pursue their objectives, which in this a winner-takes-all contest, were at his expense.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A good strategy helps you identify markets you can get traction in, as well as maintain. Acquiring customers is typically a lot more expensive than keeping them as customers. If you can </p>
