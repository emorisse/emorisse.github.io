				Process scale is about getting out of your own way: reduce your resource conflicts. In programming, we talk about orders of magnitude of complexity relative to data count, e.g., O(n), but practically the bottleneck can be any of a number of resources.  Commonly these bottlenecks are some combination of latency and throughput across CPU, storage, and network.</p>
<p>The downside to this analysis is it usually does not take into account how the bottleneck could change over time as costs, throughputs, and latencies improve at the unit level.  Take a look at three graphs I shamelessly pilfered from the <a href="http://www.iaventures.com/">IA Ventures</a> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/BenSiscovick/the-business-of-big-data-ia-ventures-8577588">presentation on Big Data</a> at  <a href="http://generalassemb.ly/">General Assembly</a> almost exactly one year ago.</p>

<p>All of the manufactured components are decreasing exponentially in cost over time.  Now, compare the oft-neglected non-fungible elements of our information economy, people.</p>

<p>Through the magic of mass manufacturing, we have taken hardware out of the running as a cost bottleneck.  We need to turn the goal of getting more out of our computers to <strong><em>using computers to get more out of our people</em></strong>.		</p>
