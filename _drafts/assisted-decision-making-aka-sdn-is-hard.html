<blockquote><p><strong>"When we asked about SDN, thirty-four percent said they were more likely to see Elvis, Bigfoot, or the Loch Ness Monster than an actual SDN deployment" </strong>Inbar Lasser-Raab, senior director of marketing for enterprise networking at Cisco, (<a href="http://www.internetnews.com/infra/elvis-or-sdn-what-are-you-more-likely-to-see.html">Enterprise Networking Planet</a> via <a href="http://www.internetnews.com/itmanagement/say-what-may10.html">Sean Michael Kerner</a>).</p></blockquote>
