<p>Enterprise software is too big, too complicated, too complex for customers to know exactly what they're getting. No matter how much we progress in making software observable, trialable, and easier to use, the scope of testing in exactly the customers' environment is always limited.</p>

<p>CUSTOMERS BUY SOFTWARE, BUT THEY'RE SOLD PROMISES </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Customers buy software, but they're sold promises. Promises the vendor will advance the circumstances the customer seeks to accomplish.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When vendors harp on about the importance of presentation and professionalism, when we hear about the need for brand consistency, they're talking about the promise. Everyone who talks to customers is part of the promise. All sales material is part of the promise. Every webinar, seminar, conference, and user summit are part of the promise. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you put into words, what's your promise to your customers?</p>
