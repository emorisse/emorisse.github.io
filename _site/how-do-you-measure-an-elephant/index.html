<p>A couple of years ago, <a href="https://twitter.com/crosslogic">Massimo Ferrari</a> and I created the most extensive and thorough financial evaluation of OpenStack, which we called <a href="http://www.redhat-cloudstrategy.com/elephant-in-the-room-whats-the-tco-for-an-openstack-cloud/">Elephant in the Room</a>. We talked about it a lot, met a lot of customers doing amazing things, and received a lot of nice press coverage. Pulling together this type of research is a lot of work, and the hope was it would do more than help a few customers. The hope was it would help change the conversation we, as an industry, are having around cloud. That's ambitious, I know, but I'm an optimist and was convinced we needed more understanding of financial implications of our technology choices.</p>
<p>Using some quick R<a href="#one">¹</a> for statistical testing on the results of search phrase "cloud tco" on Google Trends, there is a <strong>sustained 42% increase</strong> in that search phrase following our blog post. I don't know whether our blog post and talks around the world caused it, but the stats are significant (p &lt;&lt; 0.01), and it sure is a heck of a coincidence.</p>
