Not to be missed.  I had forgotten when I made reservations I noted "Birthday" in special comments, as it was my husband's belated birthday lunch. The server came out with small homemade chocolate cupcake with "happy birthday" written in chocolate on the plate along with a candle. What a nice surprise.  Service was perfection throughout the meal.</pre>
<pre>Google is in talks about a possible acquisition of Twitch, a fast-growing, live-video-streaming service, according to two people familiar with the matter.</pre>
<pre>The talks are at an early stage, and a deal isn't imminent, the people said. The potential purchase price couldn't be learned. Twitch also has considered raising additional funding instead of selling the company, according to one of the people.</pre>
<pre>Big media companies are hunting for elusive teen viewers so they can groom the online personalities drawing those audiences and bring them to their other distribution channels. Here are a couple of reasons why a Twitch deal would be unique.</pre>
<pre>Twitch, launched in <span id="OBJ_PREFIX_DWT1745_com_zimbra_date"><span id="OBJ_PREFIX_DWT1746_com_zimbra_date">June 2011</span></span>, is the most popular Internet destination for watching and broadcasting videogame play. The startup raised $20 million from investors, including Thrive Capital and videogame-maker Take-Two Interactive Software TTWO -0.28%  in September.</pre>
<pre>For Google, Twitch would be a potential boost to its YouTube video service. YouTube has its own live-streaming service for games, music, sports and news, as well as events such as Felix Baumgartner's jump from space.</pre>

Reservations would generally be a good idea, but I decided to try my luck with walkins and put my name down at both and start the race. Ultimately, the wait time was approximately the same, so I decided to go to the more famed  Kitchen.  The concept behind  Kitchen seems simple enough, turn high quality ingredients into simple and pleasing dishes.
