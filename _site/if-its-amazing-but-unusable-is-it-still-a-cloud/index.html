<h1>If it’s amazing, but unusable, is it still a cloud?</h1>

				In Boston this week planning for the new fiscal year, I stayed in a brand new boutique hotel. So brand new that the price was well below any of the local chains, and they hadn’t worked out all of their kinks.</p>
<p>The look and comforts of the room was excellent: clean design furniture, Lavazza in-room coffee, great shower, fireplace, big fluffy towels, the works. It was a beautiful room, and no expense was spared in making guests comfortable in this small but luxurious place. But, then I had to use the room.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Hard wood floors made the room loud. The paint showed scuffs. There were light switches everywhere, and it took some playing to figure how to turn on the lights I wanted. The sink prevented the shower door from opening more than half-way. I had to move the pedestal holding the toilet paper to get to the toilet, and gave up figuring out to turn on the fireplace.</p>

<p>They spent a lot of money getting the best, but the room was ridiculously hard to live in.</p>
