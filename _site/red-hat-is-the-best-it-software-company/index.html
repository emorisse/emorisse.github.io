<p><a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/brooks/">Rodney Brooks</a>, co-founder of <a href="http://www.irobot.com/">iRobot</a> and winner of the individual award for IT Hardware, made the joke that it was nice to have a hardware category, because we software guys never give hardware credit. I can think of a few jokes in the other direction, but he does have a point: none of us will be successful without each other. That's why the evening was so much fun...</p>
<p>The room was full of customers and even some partners getting recognition for their work. These are the folks who have made us successful. I can't wait to see what's next!</p>

So, it's probably good for me that we won.</p>
