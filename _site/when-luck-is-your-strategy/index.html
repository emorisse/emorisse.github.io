<h1>When Luck Is Your Strategy</h1>

<p class="view">by erich</p>

<p>
				M.R.D. Foot tells a story of an underground agent forced to transport a B-2 wireless set (radio) through a railway station in which German forces were conducting random checks of luggage and personnel. The radio which the agent was carrying was a distinct size and shape and thus easily recognizable to alert police forces. The underground operative, realizing the precariousness of his situation, initiated a cunning security measure he presumed would reduce his risks.</p>
<p>He, reached a big terminus by train; carrying only his B2 in its little case; saw a boy of about twelve struggling with a big one; and said genially (in the local language) "Let's change loads, shall we?" He took care to go through in front of the boy; there was no trouble. Round the first corner, they changed cases back. The boy said "It's as well they didn't stop you; mine's full of revolvers."</p>
