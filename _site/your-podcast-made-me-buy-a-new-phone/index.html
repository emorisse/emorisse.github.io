<div dir="auto">I have an iPhone 6. It is not a happy phone. It is sad, angry, and generally disappointed to still be in commission and yearns to be put out on a ice flow. It generally expresses its displeasure by passive aggressively inventing remaining battery percentage, rebooting at whim, and pretending storage is full.</div>

<div dir="auto">So, long preamble over, I was out for a jog this weekend. An embarrassingly rare occasion, and one I take to listen to podcasts. This run’s selection was the <a href="https://dgshow.org/164">Dave and Gunnar Show</a> with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobs3/">Bob St. Clair</a>. And it was great! I was full of thoughtful humility, and smart dogged drive to be better at that ugly transition from individual contributor to leader of leaders. I’m a big fan of the show any way, and this was an exceptional episode. I’m glad I get to work with these three, even if we rarely cross paths. Thank you.</div>

<div dir="auto">Needless to say, my phone crapped out just as I turned for the run back home.</div>
